# E-commerce-Website

Celebal Internship Assignment-2. This project demonstrates an e-commerce website built using React, showcasing products through a dummy API. Users can browse products, select items, and view their selections in a cart page, where they can see the total price and the products they've selected.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It's used for handling the UI components and managing the application state.
- **Fake Store API**: A mock API used for fetching product data. This API simulates the behavior of a real e-commerce API, providing a seamless experience for users to interact with the website.

## Features

- **Product Display**: The website showcases products using the Fake Store API, allowing users to browse through a variety of items.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can select products and add them to a cart. The cart page displays the total price and the list of selected products.
- **User Convenience**: The website prioritizes user convenience with search, filter, and sort functions for personalized product discovery.
